# Week 1 Lab Report
## 1. Installing VScode

I installed my VScode and launched it with my GitHub Desktop. This is the screenshot showing what I did in my lab report at week 0.

## 2. Remotely Connecting

I logged in the remote connect by using my course account which is cs15lfa22at. It failed in the lab session due to the password changing server issue, but I figured it out later at home.

## 3. Run Some Commands

In this step, I tried several command to see how it works. 
* cd - change to the online directory
* ls - list the original file exists in the directory
* pwd - print out what is in the directory
* ls -lat - tells you when you made the files
* cp - copy the file
* cat - print out the raw file

The result of these code are shown in the screenshot.

## 4. Moving Files with scp

I created a file called WhereAmI.java and uploaded it to VScode for manipulation. After that, I use scp to save copy the file to the remote directory. Then, I used the command which is written in the remote directory to access the file.

## 5. Setting an SSH Key

I followed the instruction to install the key in my terminal. After this, I can save time entering my password when I used the scp command. Super helpful!:)

## 6. Optimizing Remote Running

I used the example command to access the file, and it is really quick to access since it only use one line. First, I need to log in through ssh. Then, I write cp, javac, and java command in one line and it works.
